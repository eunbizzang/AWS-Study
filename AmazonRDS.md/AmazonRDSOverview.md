Amazon RDS Overview
- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create database in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  - Postgres
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Aurora(AWS Proprietary database)


Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
- RDS is a managed service:
  - Automated provisioning, OS patching
  - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
  - Monitoring dashboards
  - Read replicas for improved read performance
  - Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  - Maintenance windows for upgrades
  - Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  - Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
- BUT you can’t SSH into your instances

#### Storage Auto Scaling 
- Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance
dynamically
- When RDS detects you are running out of free database
storage, it scales automatically
- Avoid manually scaling your database storage 
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage) 
- Automatically modify storage if:
  - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  - Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes 
  - 6 hours have passed since last modification 
- Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads
- Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
